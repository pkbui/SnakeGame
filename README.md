# Snake Game

An application that mimics the Snake Game on Nokia phone.

The game is operated inside a 800x600 window.

# How to play

The objective of the game is to grow the snake. The longer the snake is, the higher point you get.

In order for that to happen, the snake needs to consume as much food as possible.

Everytime food is comsume, your snake will increase by one cell horizontally or vertically.

Foods are randomly distributed in empty cells within the window.

There are only four possible directions for the snake to traverse: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

If the snake hits the boundaries or its body, you will lose.
